# Getting Started

## Rust & Initial Setup
This tutorial assumes a beginner level of programming knowledge and the Rust
programming language, but if you're new to programming or Rust it's best to
first read the [Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/).

To start out you need a new cargo binary package.
```sh
$ cargo new <package name> --bin
$ cd <package name>
```

Then you need to add the following dependencies to your Cargo.toml file.
```toml
```
