# Cleanup Plans
With the messy fast development, the library has become a bit of a mess, here's
a list of things that have to be done to clean everything up.

- Move various things in Simple2D that are consistent between multiple backends
    into the core library.
- Do a big cleanup pass over public facing APIs, add checklist items for making
    various things more consistent and easy to use.
- Clean up and fix 3D backend
