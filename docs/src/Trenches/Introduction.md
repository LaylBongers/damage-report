# Trenches
Trenches is a project to create a game based on the original Ace of Spades using
the Cobalt rendering engine. It's important that this remains a small and simple
project, it's not meant to have a complex sprawling feature set. However, it
should have some unique twist to the original concept, though that twist can be
decided on after the base mechanics are in there as it's not the primary goal.

## Goals
I am experimenting establishing a system that we can use to create clear purpose
to work towards, to know when to move on to something else, and to reflect on
work done. For this purpose there are "Goal" documents listed under Trenches
that outline various goals with tasks and reflection sections.

These goals are meant to be achievable within a relatively small amount of time,
they're not long-term goals but rather short(er)-term things to work towards and
quickly reflect on.

Each goal has a set number of tasks that need to be completed. These tasks may
evolve as they're marked off. When all tasks are completed the goal should be
considered "finished", regardless of success. The reflection should be written
and new goals should be set.
